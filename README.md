# Tsundoku

> 積読 — *tsundoku*: the Japanese habit of buying books (or manga) and letting them pile up unread.

**Tsundoku** is a personal manga collection manager with a minimalist aesthetic inspired by Japanese bookshop shelves. It lets you catalog, search, and track the reading progress of your volumes quickly, cleanly, and without friction.

## ✨ Features

- 📚 **Personal library**: a grid with all your manga, with status filters and title search.
- 📖 **Manga and volume details**: each volume has its own ISBN and an individual status (*unread*, *reading*, *read*).
- 🔍 **External ISBN search**: integration with [OpenLibrary](https://openlibrary.org) (priority) and [Google Books](https://books.google.com) as fallback.
- ⚙️ **Configurable APIs**: enable or disable external search APIs from the settings.
- ➕ **Add manually**: for those manga that don't show up in public APIs.
- 🌗 **Light and dark mode**: with a touch of Japanese vermilion (`#e63946`) as accent color.
- 🌍 **Multi-language**: Spanish and English, with automatic browser detection.
- 🔐 **Authentication**: protected access with username and password.
- 🗄️ **Local SQLite database**: no external services, no accounts, no clouds. Your data is yours.
- 🐳 **Docker-ready**: a single image, a single volume.

| Layer        | Technology                                   |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Frontend     | Vue 3 · Vite · Vue Router · Pinia · vue-i18n |
| Backend      | Node.js · Express                            |
| Database     | SQLite (via `better-sqlite3`)                |
| Packaging    | Multi-stage Docker                           |

No TypeScript, no tests, no linter — it's a small, straightforward project.

## 🚀 Build & installation

### Requirements

- **Node.js** ≥ 22
- **npm** (bundled with Node)
- On Linux, `better-sqlite3` needs `python3`, `make`, and `g++` to compile the native binding.

### Local development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

This runs concurrently:

- 🖥️ Vite client at `http://localhost:5173`
- 🛠️ Express server at `http://localhost:3000`

Calls to `/api/*` are automatically proxied to the backend by Vite, so you don't need to prefix the full URL in your code.

### Production build

```bash
npm run build         # generates dist/
npm run preview       # previews the build
node server/index.js  # serves the full app on port 3000
```

The Express server serves the static assets from `dist/` and exposes the REST API at `/api/*`.

### Docker

```bash
docker build -t tsundoku .
docker run -d \
  --name tsundoku \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -v tsundoku-data:/app/data \
  -e AUTH_USERNAME=your_username \
  -e AUTH_PASSWORD=your_secure_password \
  -e GOOGLE_BOOKS_API_KEY=your_api_key \
  tsundoku
```

> ⚠️ **Important:** You must set `AUTH_USERNAME` and `AUTH_PASSWORD` environment variables. Without them, the server will not start (returns 503). Choose a secure password for production deployments.

The SQLite database is persisted in the `/app/data` volume. The image exposes port `3000` and listens on `0.0.0.0`.

Recognized environment variables:

| Variable              | Default       | Description                                      |
|-----------------------|---------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `PORT`                | `3000`        | Express server port                              |
| `DATA_DIR`            | `/app/data`   | Directory where `tsundoku.db` is stored          |
| `NODE_ENV`            | `production`  | Runtime mode                                     |
| `AUTH_USERNAME`       | (required)    | Username for authentication                      |
| `AUTH_PASSWORD`       | (required)    | Password for authentication                      |
| `GOOGLE_BOOKS_API_KEY`| (optional)    | API key for Google Books fallback search         |

## ⚠️ About this project and Vibe Coding

This project has been built entirely through **Vibe Coding**: the practice of building software by guiding a large language model (LLM) through descriptions, iterations, and refinements in natural language, rather than writing every line of code by hand.

What does this mean for you?

- 🤖 **The code may contain bugs, inconsistencies, questionable design decisions, or "bad practices"** that slipped past both the author and the model. If something looks weird, it probably *is* weird.
- 🧪 **There is no test suite** (yet). If you touch something critical, test thoroughly before deploying.
- 🧹 **There are areas an experienced developer would probably do differently**: naming, structure, validation, accessibility, etc. Polite suggestions are welcome in the form of a PR.
- ❤️ **But it works** — and it was built with care.

### 🤝 Contributions welcome

**Pull Requests are always open.** If you want to:

- Fix a bug,
- Refactor something that hurts to look at,
- Add tests (they're missing),
- Improve accessibility, i18n, performance, anything,

…open a PR without fear. There's no strict style guide, so just be reasonable and briefly explain the *why* behind your change.

If you find a bug but don't want to (or can't) fix it, open an *issue* describing how to reproduce it.
